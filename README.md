##Reddit Cooking Text Classification Project
This project aims to classify text data from a Reddit Cooking forum into two categories: 'RELEVANT' and 'NOT_RELEVANT'. We employ Prodigy, a versatile annotation tool, to create and fine-tune four different models for text classification.

#Overview
Model 1: Basic Manually Labeled Training Text Classification Model
Model 2: Weakly Labeled Traning Text Classification Model
Model 3: Model 2 + Base Model: 'en_core_web_lg' (linked to Google Drive)
Model 4: Large Hugging Face Model (screenshots only)
Additionally, the repository contains:
